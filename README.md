Click here before  int!! 
-So hi I'm rae^^
Some people  call me rams and stuff but here's some stuff before  we int ^_^

-So I have a problem  socializing  since I don't exactly  like it a lot and it causes me too be extremely  dry unless if I'm comfortable  with you, my energy  runs out EXTREMELY fast so it's also one of the reasons  why I can be seen as dry or aggressive,
I perfer  w2i since I'm scared  to int in public  but if its more  than one person  talking  to me the I will talk publicly. 


-And ALSO please PLEASSEEE tell me when I make you uncomfortable or what makes you uncomfortable  just so I don't make you uncomfortable on accident  if I upset you, TELL ME WHAT I DID ^^ I won't get mad it actually  makes me a lot more  happy if you do so I can fix what I did..! 


-If your older than  16+ do not be jokingly inappropriate  with me, that's all I ask 0-0 

-Uhh I have hyperfixation  on Toya so if I talk about  him too much and you don't like that tell me

-if I snap at you it's an accident. 

-I'm really  soft or weird when I'm tired, and usually  join pt  when I am I join whenever  I overwork myself  or want a quick break  from work or school <3


-English isn't my first language I will  have  some mistakes  when I'm typing
